## Notes about Kibana

G2P v0.5 is using Kibana verison 5.5.3. 

A known issue of this version of kibana is that single count visualizations, like that used top left of the g2p dashboard, have unexpected scrolling behavior. 

This issue has been [documented](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/14066) to the Elastic company, and is likely to be resolved in newer versions of kibana; perhaps v5.6.0. 

We intend to update to the newer version once this issue is resolved by Elastic.
